I am an Ecologist at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute and a Research Fellow with the San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research. I conduct research at the intersection of animal behavior and conservation biology with the goal of simultaneously advancing basic understanding of nonhuman animal societies and providing results relevant for conservation objectives.
